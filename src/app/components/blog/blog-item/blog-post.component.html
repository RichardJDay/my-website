    <h1>How I Built a CI/CD Pipeline with Azure DevOps</h1>

    <p>
      I recently built a fully automated pipeline using Azure DevOps to deploy an Angular + .NET application.
      Hereâ€™s how I tackled the infrastructure and automation steps.
    </p>
  
    <h2>Stack Used</h2>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Angular 17 + .NET 8 API</li>
      <li>Azure DevOps Pipelines (YAML)</li>
      <li>Docker & Azure Container Apps</li>
      <li>Terraform for infrastructure provisioning</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h2>ðŸ“¦ Setting Up CI</h2>
    <pre><code class="language-yaml">
  trigger:
    branches:
      include:
        - main
  stages:
    - stage: Build
      jobs:
        - job: Build_Angular
          ...
    </code></pre>
  
    <h2>ðŸš€ Results</h2>
    <p>
      Deployment time was cut from 30 minutes to ~5 minutes, and we now have reliable, testable builds
      across all environments.
    </p>
